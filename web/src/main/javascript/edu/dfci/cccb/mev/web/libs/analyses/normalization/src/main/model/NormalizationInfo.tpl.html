<div><p>CSS: Cumulative Count Normalization: The counts slot holds the raw count data representing (along the rows) the number of reads annotated for a particular feature and (along the columns) the sample.</p>
<p>TSS : Total Sum Scaling Normalization</p>
<p>DEseq: Geomatric mean normalization implemented in DESeq. Given a matrix or data
frame of count data, this function estimates the size factors as follows: Each column is
divided by the geometric means of the rows. The median (or, if requested, another
location estimator) of these ratios (skipping the genes with a geometric mean of zero)
is used as the size factor for this column.</p>
<p>TMM: The trimmed mean of M-values normalization method as implemented in edgeR.
Calculate Normalization Factors to Align Columns of a Count Matrix based on edgeR normalization.</p>
<p>Upper-quartile: Upper quartile normalization as implemented in edgeR.</p>
<p>VST: Variance stabilized transformation as implemented in DESeq2.</p>
<p>PA: Presence of Absence of expression</p>
